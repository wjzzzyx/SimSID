# SimSID
This is repo for our TPAMI paper <b>Exploiting Structural Consistency of Chest Anatomy for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Radiography Images</b>.

We introduce SimSID, which is an update on our previous work [SQUID](https://github.com/tiangexiang/SQUID).

Code will be released in the future.
